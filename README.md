I am so proud and thrilled to finally be able to build a website that reflects my taste and personality after 6 months of consistent and hard work in learning programming. I'm still in an ongoing endless learning process, I'm trying to keep myself up-to-date as I'm also trying to adapt best practices to my code but for now, I hope you have a great time visiting my website that I built with the current knowledge that I have. :)

I'll be updating my website and sharing posts that are related to my journey into programming throughout the days and years.
